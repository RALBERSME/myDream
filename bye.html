      “Nothing happens unless first we dream,” the American poet Carl Sandburg
      said once and he was absolutely right. If you want change in your life,
      you can either go with the river that flows at your doorstep. But then you
      give up control and leave the decisions about your life to others. Or you
      make decisions about your life yourself. In this case, YOU are the pilot.
      However you need a vision of what your life should be like. You need a
      dream. Without it, you will lack orientation as to where your journey
      should go.<br /><br />Thank you for visiting my website. All the best.<br /><br />
