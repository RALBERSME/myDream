          Emily squealed happily. With her little fingers she squeezed her
          storybook tightly to herself and continued to babble incessantly. She
          told about castles, fairies and mythical creatures that all seemed to
          climb out of the book and to join her. Her steel blue eyes glittered
          with joy.<br />It was obvious that she felt in seventh heaven when she
          danced with Sleeping Beauty or waved to Mrs Holle. <br /><br />
          A stranger might not have perceived her dance as this, because Emily
          didn't swing her legs while dancing like other dancers would. She
          moved almost exclusively in her imagination and described in bright
          colors the images that came to her mind. She circled her hands,
          clapped and cheered.
          <br /><br />
          Mick, her father, could watch her for hours. They were the happiest
          moments for him in a long time, since the car accident. A truck had
          taken the right of way from his wife Suzan when she was on her way
          into the city and hit the side of the silver Mini Cooper with full
          force. Suzan didn't have the slightest chance of survival. When the
          ambulance arrived after just a few minutes, the paramedics were only
          able to save his daughter Emily alive.
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          Mick still felt an icy chill run down his spine when he thought about
          that disastrous day. Suzan had always been his true love. How many
          hours had they laughed together, joked around, traveled the world,
          hugged each other or exchanged caresses?

          <br /><br />
          Her skin was as soft as a peach and when she stroked his cheek with
          her hand in the morning, he knew what he lived for. Then they got
          married and Emily was born. Emily was Mick's second great love. She
          was a bright, pretty girl, now four years old, who should have had a
          little brother soon.

          <br /><br />
          A stream of tears ran down his cheek. He pressed a tissue to his face
          and quickly turned away from Emily. He didn't want her to see him cry
          again. She should keep the feeling that everything was wonderful in
          the world in which she now lived.

          <br /><br />

          Emily hadn't been the same since the car accident. Not only that she
          could no longer move her legs, which was bad enough in itself. Her
          psyche had also changed. Doctors said she was in a temporary state of
          shock. But no one could say how long this situation would last and
          whether it would ever disappear again.

          <br /><br />
          Until recently, Emily had been very clingy and couldn't stand it when
          Suzan was away for long periods of time. She then screamed at the top
          of her lungs and aggressively threw her toys at the front door. Since
          the car accident, she hadn't even mentioned her mother or even asked
          about her. Mick was also sure that Emily was suffering from an immense
          loss of memory. Could she really not remember the time before the
          accident? Was she only living in the land of her dreams?
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          Emily particularly liked it when Mick read her something from the
          Brothers Grimm fairy tale book. It's best to always have the same
          stories: Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, the Frog Prince, Rapunzel and
          Mrs. Holle, those were her favorites. Often, while he was reading,
          Emily would tell her father to get a pillow for a fairy or offer her
          something to eat. The fairytale creatures were as present in Emily's
          imagination as if they were family members.

          <br /><br />
          This went on for several months. Then Emily's condition deteriorated
          noticeably. The doctors referred her to the local hospital for
          observation.<br />
          <em>“We'll put her in an induced coma for a while,”</em> suggested the
          chief doctor.
          <em
            >“Her brain is totally overloaded. She probably can't get rid off
            the psychological stress from the car accident. But she absolutely
            has to relax now, also mentally, otherwise the brain damage will
            only get worse.”
          </em>
          <br /><br />
          In his great need and because he trusted the doctors, Mick agreed.<br />
          The coma was expected to last three months.
        </p>

        <p class="frame">
          Already the first day was hell for Mick. Seeing his own child lying
          motionless in the intensive care room tore his heart apart. The
          doctors decided that it would be better for both of them if Mick only
          came for half an hour a day.<br />
          From then on, Mick appeared every afternoon, spent the time the
          doctors had agreed to him at his daughter's bedside and then returned
          home. <br /><br />He was no longer of any use at home. He actually
          loved his carpentry profession and was respected for his precise
          interior design. But he could no longer concentrate on his work, cut
          valuable wood seemingly haphazardly and drilled in the wrong places.
          After just a few days he had to admit that he could no longer carry
          out customer orders in this condition. So he locked the workshop and
          hung a sign on the door saying the business was closed. From then on,
          he spent the whole day lying on his sofa, feeling empty and tired.<br />

          He only woke up for half an hour in the afternoon, when he could be
          with his daughter in the hospital. <br /><br />
          Lars was concerned about his friend's change in personality. Mick
          definitely needed help, that was obvious. Since he felt overwhelmed by
          this task, he turned to the doctors in the hospital and spoke to a
          psychologist.<em
            >“The chief doctor will extend the artificial coma for an indefinite
            period of time. This is the only way he can give Emily a real chance
            to recover,” </em
          >Doctor Vogler confided to him.
          <em
            >“It is important that Mick gets a meaningful job that frees him
            from depression and gives him meaning in life again,”</em
          >
          he clarified.
        </p>

        <p class="frame">
          When Mick returned to the hospital the next day, Doctor Vogler
          intercepted him and invited him to his office for a cup of coffee.<br />
          <em>“Mick”</em>, he put his hand on Mick's shoulder,
          <em
            >“Your daughter needs your help now. Not in the hospital, there the
            doctors take care of her with all their specialist knowledge. But
            outside of it you can also help your daughter. I'm absolutely sure
            about that.”</em
          >
          He took a long pause, probably hoping that Mick would come out of the
          shell he had holed up in. But Mick just sat there in silence.
          <br /><br />

          Doctor Vogler poured him a cup of steaming coffee and placed it on the
          wooden side table in front of him. The scent of coffee spread its
          warming smell throughout the room. Doctor Vogler sat down in his
          leather chair and began to fill his pipe. He leisurely reached into
          the tobacco pouch and squeezed a handful of tobacco into the pipe. It
          wasn't his style to smoke in front of patients, but today, he knew, he
          needed a lot of time. He drew a match across the box with pressure and
          held it in the pipe. Then he started to pull on it until he could make
          the first puffs with pleasure.

          <br /><br />
          Mick, watching him, felt as if he saw his grandfather in the leather
          armchair. He also liked to light a pipe in the evenings. Then he sat
          on the bench in front of the house and enjoyed the last rays of
          sunshine of the day. When he still was the little Mick, he liked to
          run out to grandpa. Grandpa then lifted him onto his lap and together
          they watched the cloud formations in the sky.

          <br /><br />
          Doctor Vogler watched with satisfaction as Mick's body gradually
          relaxed. Then he asked him:
          <em
            >“Mick, what is Emily's big dream? She's probably told you about it
            many times, hasn't she?"</em
          ><br />
          Then he puffed on his pipe again. There was silence, but Doctor Vogler
          could see in Mick's face how his eyes were moving. From right to left,
          then down and up again. A good sign, as the psychologist knew. Mick
          searched for an answer. <br /><br />

          Mick sipped the coffee briefly before turning back to Doctor Vogler.
          <em
            >“Since the accident, Emily has only been living in a fairytale
            world. She talks to mythical creatures, she even dances with them.
            In her mind, they are always around her and that makes her
            happy.”</em
          >
          Mick was breathing heavily.<em
            >“I always had to promise her in the evenings that I would build her
            a castle with tables and cupboards and chairs and everything that
            went with it. She wanted us all to live there, her and me and the
            fairy tale characters.”</em
          >

          Mick fell silent again. His gaze wandered along the floorboards and
          was lost in nothingness. <br /><br />
          <em>“And,”</em> Doctor Vogel's voice sounded provocative,
          <em>“How much of the castle have they already built?”</em>
          <br /><br />
          Mick looked at him blankly. <em>“Em...excuse me?”</em><br /><em
            >“You understood me correctly. How far along are you with the
            construction of the castle? <br />Can I take a look at it?”</em
          >
          <br /><br />
          <em>„But“</em>, Mick was very confused,
          <em
            ><br />„but there… there is no castle. I never set out to build
            one.“</em
          >
          <br /><br />
          <em>“Then it's about time”</em>, Doctor Vogler nodded encouragingly.
          He pulled his gold watch out of his pocket and looked at the dial.<br />
          <em>“Mick, I have to go to another appointment. You'll excuse me."</em
          >, he brought the conversation to an end.<br />

          Mick said goodbye and left the hospital. He was a little confused by
          the conversation he had just had. He couldn't get it out of his mind
          all night long. He kept thinking about the castle and the more he
          thought about it, the more real it became in his head. The turrets,
          the drawbridge, the princess on the gallery. Everything began to take
          on more shape and color.
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          Before daybreak he was in his workshop. He pulled out the largest
          drawing sheet he had from the shelf and began to put his nightly
          artwork on paper. Equipped with a ruler and pencil, he drew the floor
          plans, then the masonry, the galleries up to the roof gable. Always
          new ideas drove him to erase something here and to add new battlements
          there, or a window sill or embrasures.<br />
          He lost all sense of time and only noticed at sunset how the day had
          passed.<br />
          His thoughts revolved around the castle all night long.

          <br /><br />
          This went on day after day until he had designed a magnificent castle,
          with a balcony for Mrs. Holle, a high tower for Rapunzel, a ballroom
          for Sleeping Beauty, countless small rooms for the dwarves and of
          course a princess suite for Emily.

          <br /><br />
          Now everything just had to be built and it had to be built exactly as
          he had drawn it, that was clear to Mick. In addition to the castle,
          there were stables, a large fountain for the frog prince, a forest
          with a witch's house, knight's castles and much more.

          <br /><br />
          He knew that the buildings and the land would require a lot of money.
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          As a result, he decided to ask his bank for a loan. Packed with all
          his drawings, he went to see his banker. The banker greeted him
          warmly, as he had known Mick as a good and reliable customer for
          years.<br /><em>“How can I help you today?”</em>, he asked him with a
          broad smile. But his friendliness quickly gave way to a pale,
          desperate look when Mick put his castle plans on the table and said he
          wanted to build a fairytale land.<br />

          <em>
            “A fairytale land? Mick, you're not serious. Bake a gingerbread
            house and eat it when you're hungry. But a fairytale land with
            palaces and castles? This makes no financial sense. And it's just
            not worth it for us as a bank. With such a risk, we will never see
            our money again. Sorry, Mick, but not with us,”</em
          >
          and he quickly said goodbye to Mick. <br /><br />The doctors at the
          hospital not only had Emily's well-being in mind, they also worried
          about Mick, who continued to see his daughter every day. Occasionally
          the doctors would talk to him and find out what he was dealing with
          and how he was feeling. The euphoria that had been visible to everyone
          after the conversation with Doctor Vogler had gradually dissipated.<br /><em>
            “I contact several banks every day. I can't build the fairytale park
            without a loan,” </em
          >Mick had told them,<em
            >“but no one takes my request seriously. Everyone explains that it's
            a losing proposition and that they won't risk any money on it. They
            believe that no adult wants to have fun with fairytale creatures in
            their free time. I've heard more NOs in the last few weeks than I've
            ever heard in my entire life.<br />
            It's hopeless.”</em
          >
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          Doctor Vogler also noticed the increasingly depressive mood. That's
          why he sought to talk to the doctors.<em
            >“We haven't seen any improvement in Emily since she's been in an
            induced coma. There is now much to suggest that her condition will
            no longer improve."</em
          >, they told him openly. <br /><em
            >“And if she was brought back from her coma?”</em
          >, asked Doctor Vogler.<br /><em
            >“We don't know what will happen next. But we can try,”</em
          >
          the chief doctor decided. <br /><br />
          Doctor Vogler advised the doctors to discuss this option with Mick
          immediately. Therefore it happened that Emily was brought back from
          the coma. Mick sat on her bed and gently held her small hand in his
          big one. He thought he sensed something stirring inside Emily and
          convinced himself that her fingertips were twitching slightly.

          <br /><br />
          <em>"Do you hear me"</em>, Mick jumped up from the chair,
          <em>“Emily, do you hear me?”</em><br />

          But the girl was unresponsive. That didn't change the next day or the
          day after that. After a week, the doctors told Mick, who was meanwhile
          completely exhausted, that he should go home. They would call him as
          soon as Emily woke up. But since she hadn't woken up for a whole week
          after the end of the induced coma, one had to remain realistic. Maybe
          she would never wake up again and he should be more comfortable with
          that thought.
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          Mick left the hospital like a zombie.
          <em>“His daughter, never wake up again..”</em>, Mick just ran across
          the street, not looking to the right or left. He didn't even hear the
          loud braking of the Porsche driver, who was only able to avoid
          touching him by a millimetre. Exhausted, he sat down on a park bench.
          He couldn't take it anymore.

          <br /><em
            >“Are you still okay? Just walk across the street! I almost ran you
            over!” </em
          >, a man in a dark suit snapped at him.<br />
          But Mick no longer noticed even that and collapsed completely.
          <br /><br />
          When he regained consciousness, he noticed that he was lying on a sofa
          with the view at a garden with a fountain. Everything seemed strange
          to him, but the fountain, the clay figures on it and the rose hedge
          reminded him of a fairytale world.
          <em>"Emily"</em>, he murmured,
          <em>“Emily, I'll build you your castle.”</em> <br /><br />
          The man in the dark suit approached him from the other end of the
          room. He had taken Mick home with him and was now listening to his
          words in amazement. He seemed increasingly interested in the stranger
          who had almost run into his car less than an hour ago. So they got
          into a deeper conversation and Mick confided in him out of gratitude.
          He talked about Emily and her dream and his countless attempts to get
          a loan, but above all about how Emily didn't want to wake up and maybe
          never would. The man in the dark suit listened attentively, nodded,
          offered comfort and brought Mick back home in the evening.
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          It wasn't yet midday when the hospital called Mick the next day.<br />
          <em>“Come on, quickly, Emily has woken up. Come!"</em><br />, the
          doctor's assistant's voice rang out over the line.<br />
          Mick didn't need to be told twice and rushed to his daughter, whose
          steely eyes lit up at him. She was responsive again. It was still
          difficult for her to speak, but she was able to squeeze his hand with
          her fingers. One or two words also came out of her mouth.<br />
          She half closed her eyes and wheezed deeply. It was unmistakable how
          much energy every movement cost her.
          <em>“Sh...sh..daddy.”</em>, it echoed, <em>“my …shh.”</em>. She took a
          breath.<br />
          Mick gently stroked her hair.
          <em>“It's all good, my darling. Don't try too hard. I am here."</em>
          Emily's eyes became heavy and she fell back into a deep sleep.
          <br /><br />
          Mike couldn't believe it. Finally Emily was back in life. Finally. A
          doctor told him that a man came in the morning. He asked about
          Emily.<br /><em>"I saw him"</em>, the head nurse interrupted him.<br /><em
            >“Through the hallway window I saw him sitting next to Emily,
            talking and talking. Because I have other patients, I had to leave.
            At some point the control device beeped and I ran back to Emily. She
            opened her eyes and the man was gone."</em
          >, she explained. <br /><br />
          Who could that have been, Mick asked himself. But since the head nurse
          and doctors were called to an emergency, now was not the time to ask.
          Mick was extremely tired and trudged home overjoyed.
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          The next morning he wanted to be at Emily's hospital at 10 a.m. after
          the doctor`s visit. He was just leaving his house when a post man
          brought him a registered letter. Mick put it in his jacket pocket and
          rushed to Emily. So it wasn't until the afternoon that he got a chance
          to read it.<br /><em>“Oh the registered letter”</em>, he thought.<em
            >“Certainly an unpaid bill”</em
          >. Annoyed, Mick pulled the registered letter out of his jacket
          pocket, opened it and read the few lines written there. Mick shook his
          head. He couldn't believe what he was reading.<br /><em
            >“I spoke to your daughter about your project and promised her that
            I would take care of the finances. Come to my office tomorrow so we
            can sort everything out."</em
          >
          Signature illegible.<br />
          Whoever wrote that might have been serious after all, Mick decided. He
          took a taxi to the address mentioned and was surprised to be dropped
          off in front of the very villa where he had been the day before.
          <br /><br />
          He rang the bell excitedly. The man in the dark suit opened it
          happily:
          <em>“Mick, I was expecting you, come in.”</em> Mick entered the villa
          in disbelief. Over a full-bodied Chardonney, the man introduced
          himself as Henry Peterson, a major investor in the real estate sector.
          He told Mick that he had visited little Emily in the hospital the day
          before. He wanted to know how she was doing.<br />
          Mick was surprised:
          <em>“But you didn't even know Emily. Why did you visit her?”</em
          ><br /><em>“Well, I've never met Emily before.”</em>, "that's true,"
          Henry said.
          <em
            >“But you told me so much about her that I already felt like I knew
            her.”</em
          ><br />
          Mick now became curious,<br />
          <em
            >“The doctors said they talked to her for an hour. May I ask what
            about?”</em
          ><br /><br /><em>"With pleasure"</em>, A smile crossed Henry's lips.
          <em
            >“I told her that her daddy is currently building a castle for her
            and for Mrs. Holle and Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and all the
            others and it would be important if she took a look at it to make
            sure that everything was done right.”</em
          ><br /><em>“And then she woke up?”</em>, Mick couldn't believe it.<br /><em
            >“Yes, what do you think? Of course she woke up. I had just foisted
            responsibility for the construction on her.”</em
          >, Henry announced with a grin and couldn't help but wink.
          <em
            >“Now let's get to work. We can't let Emily down. Show me your
            plans. I'll bring in my in-house architect and then we'll pick a
            property and get started.”</em
          >
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          <em>“And the financing”</em>, Mick asked.<em
            >“Don't worry, I'll take care of it”</em
          >, Henry clarified.<br /><em
            >“Yes, that worries me now. How do I know you're serious and I won't
            be deep in debt in a few weeks?”</em
          ><br />Mick had to be certain that everything was going on
          correctly.<br /><br /><em
            >“Mick, I know how you feel. I lost my wife to cancer two years ago.
            I have experienced first hand what an illness does to a person. How
            the life of a person you love goes down, how she suffers, fights,
            doesn't want to give up and then there is no escape. I would have
            done anything for my wife, even in the last few days I would have
            picked the stars from the sky for her. But I wasn't there. I didn't
            know it were her last days. She always said that everything was okay
            under the circumstances and that I should still go on the business
            trip. But I wasn't there. Do you understand? I wasn't with her in
            her last hour! I've never forgiven myself for that."</em
          >, he had to take a deep breath. Then he continued:
          <em
            >“When I heard you talk about your daughter, I thought this was a
            way to make up for what I can no longer make up for with my wife.
            Please Mick, grant me this wish. I'm an investor, I can financially
            afford this project... and frankly, I don't think your concept is
            bad at all. We could set up an elite hotel in the castle and then
            I'll add it to my portfolio. I think it will work fine.<br />
            Trust me, I'm a professional in real estate.”</em
          >
          <br /><br />
          The first divisional launch took place six months later. Henry had
          selected a plot of land from his existing properties and, through good
          connections, received an expedited building permit.<br />
          Emily was recovering from the effects of her coma. She was now so
          stable that she was able to eat and drink independently again and also
          participate in shorter conversations. She knew that her castle was
          under construction and that she and all her friends would soon be able
          to move into the magnificent building. Sometimes the doctors heard her
          inviting Little Red Riding Hood or discussing with Hansel and Gretel
          whether the palace garden needed a labyrinth.
          <br /><br />
          Since Emily had gotten better, Mick's bear powers had returned. He
          worked in Fairyland from morning to afternoon, then spent an hour with
          Emily and returned to the construction site afterwards. For Emily, an
          hour was as valuable as a whole day, because she still spent most of
          the day sleeping.
          <br /><br />
          The construction progressed quickly. The main castle was already in
          place at the end of March. The garden and labyrinth were laid out in
          April, the witch's house followed in May and the magnificent opening
          with all the important ones was scheduled for June. Fairytale
          characters and brass music are planned. Many young people applied to
          celebrate in costumes as fairytale creatures. The invitations had been
          sent and the press articles had been printed. As a professional real
          estate agent, Henry left nothing to chance.
        </p>
        <p class="frame">
          The night before the opening, Emily suffered a serious setback. Mick,
          Henry and all the doctors were called in to consult. Mick took his
          girl in his arms again, then she stopped breathing forever. Great
          sadness spread through the room.<br /><em
            >“What a shame that she could never see her castle,”</em
          ><br />the head nurse interrupted the paralyzing silence.<br /><em
            >“No”</em
          >, Henry objected,<em
            >“she saw her castle. She always saw it, long before we even started
            building it. It was her dream. She lived it, precisely because she
            saw it.”</em
          ><br />
          Tears ran down Mick's cheeks and yet he had to smile.<br />

          <em>„It is true. She always saw her castle“.</em> <br /><br />
          It was decided to celebrate the opening of the park on the same day in
          honor of Emily, and since it was the day they had been inviting for
          for weeks, guests came in droves. Henry and Mick did not attend the
          opening. But afterwards they were told what a great celebration it had
          been. <br /><br />
          The park was a great success for both of them. For Henry from a
          financial perspective. For Mick, for a different reason, because
          whenever the old sadness over the loss of his loved ones overwhelmed
          him, he went out into the castle`s park and watched the many children
          who were romping, laughing and bawling on the carousels, ponies and in
          the labyrinth. And then his joy in life returned because he knew that
          his Emily lived on in them, with many, many dreams.

          What, you think the story is just an invention or a lie? Well, I have
          invented it, but it's not as otherworldly as you think. There are
          people who had similar dreams and who also experienced a lot of
          discomfort, financial worries and problems. Who had to fight against
          the statements of others that the project was said to be doomed to
          failure as well. Here is such a person with his dream and I am sure
